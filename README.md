**Here I have created a UI for searching a room with filtering Bed, Location etc...**
**I have created this UI without using any Framwork or Libraray, We can say that it's in pure HTML,CSS,JS
Here I have Used the CSS features like Flex, Grid.
And I used the SCSS over CSS and in SCSS i used Var, nesting**
**The UI which I have created is responsive. On Mobiles , Tablets or on Big screens it would be working fine without any UI break**
**In that I used hover effects using shadow or colors**
