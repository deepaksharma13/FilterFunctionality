**Here I have created a UI form searching a room with filtering Bed, Location etc...**
**I have created this UI without using any Framwork or Libraray, We can say that it's in pure HTML,CSS,JS
Here I have Used the CSS features like Flex, Grid
And I used the SCSS over CSS**
**The UI which I have created is responsive. On Mobile , Tab or on Big screen it would be working fine without any UI break**
**In that I used hover effects using shadow or colors**
